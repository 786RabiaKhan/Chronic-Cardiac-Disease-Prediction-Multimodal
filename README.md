Chronic-Cardiac-Disease-Prediction-Multimodal
This project implements a multimodal deep learning model to predict chronic cardiac disease using a multimodal approach utilizing two ECG datasets using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 
About
One Dataset is from Kaggle, It consists ECG images of AHB (Atrioventricular Heart Block), COVID-19, HMI (Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy), MI (Myocardial Infarction) and NORMAL (ECG). It consist of ECG images each of which is 640x640 jpg. Second dataset is taken from Mendley which in an online data repository. It consists of ECG images of Abnormal Heart Beat, Myocardial Infraction, History of Myocardial Infraction (HMI), and Normal. Each of which ECG image is 2213x1572 jpg.
To run the code, the following libraries are required: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, sklearn, and rarfile. These can be installed using a package manager such as pip.
Process of Training and evaluation
The training process begins with the upload of two ECG datasets, ECG.rar and ECGN.rar, which are extracted into respective directories for further processing. During preprocessing, the images are resized to 128x128 pixels, normalized, and their labels are encoded into categorical format. To enhance model generalization, data augmentation techniques such as rotation, width and height shifts, and horizontal flips are applied. The model architecture features two independent CNN streams, one for each dataset (ECG and ECGN). Each stream comprises convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dropout layers for regularization. After the features are extracted from these streams, they are concatenated in a merged layer to integrate information from both datasets. This combined feature representation is then passed through multiple dense layers, which refine the extracted features and learn high-level patterns. The final dense layer is equipped with a softmax activation function to output the classification results. The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function. 
A 5-fold cross-validation strategy is employed to ensure robust performance evaluation. For each fold, the model is trained on a subset of the data and validated on another, with early stopping implemented to prevent overfitting by monitoring the validation loss. In this approach, the dataset is split into multiple subsets using cross-validation, specifically a 5-fold strategy. For each fold, the model is trained on a portion of the data while the remaining portion is used for validation. The validation accuracy and loss are tracked throughout the training process, and the modelâ€™s parameters are adjusted to minimize the validation loss.  After training, the model's performance is evaluated to derive final metrics. The average training accuracy, validation accuracy, and test accuracy, along with fold-wise performance metrics, are visualized using detailed plots, providing insights into model behavior and robustness.
